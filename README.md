[![Async Ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/Asynchronous-‚úî-green?logo=asyncio)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)

A high-performance web vulnerability scanner powered by Python, specializing in detecting **SQL Injection** and **XSS vulnerabilities**, featuring lightning-fast deep scanning with asynchronous technology.


## üåü Key Features
- **Dual Vulnerability Detection**: Precise identification of SQLi (`' OR '1'='1`) and XSS (`<script>alert(1)</script>`)
- **Smart Form Tracking**: Auto-parses HTML forms and tests all input fields
- **Asynchronous Deep Scan**: 5x faster than traditional scanners using `aiohttp` + `asyncio`
- **Visual Alerts**: Terminal color-coded warning system (Red/Yellow/Green)
- **Recursive Crawling**: Customizable scan depth (default: 2 levels)
- **Logging**: Auto-generates detailed scan reports (`vuln_scanner.log`)

## üöÄ Quick Start
### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Terminal with ANSI color support (Linux/macOS recommended or Windows Terminal)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VulnHunterAI.git
cd VulnHunterAI
```
 Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Basic Usage
```
python vuln_scanner.py
# Enter target URL (include http/https)
```
Advanced Configuration (Code Customization)
```
# Customize scan depth (default: 2)
async def crawl_and_scan(start_url, depth=3)  # Modify here

# Extend detection rules (edit PAYLOADS dict)

PAYLOADS = {
    "SQL Injection": "' OR '1'='1",
    "XSS": "<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>",
    "New Vuln": "your_payload_here"  # Add new rules
}
```
üìä Sample Output
```
===  Terminal Scanner ===
Enter target URL (with http/https): https://example.com

[*] Scanning: https://example.com
[!] Potential SQL Injection found at https://example.com/login (Payload: ' OR '1'='1)
[OK] XSS test passed at https://example.com/contact
[*] Scanning: https://example.com/about
[OK] SQL Injection test passed at https://example.com/about
```
